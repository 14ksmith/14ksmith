# 14ksmith

Hello, and welcome 👋🏼

I am software developer, Chemist, and previously a
Biologist! After falling in love with software, I am transitioning to focus on
programming
full time!

I am currently learning more about/building server-side programs that utilize concurrency to speed up I/O bound operations and CPU bound tasks.


I am currently interested in joining a team of developers to build exciting systems in Python.

Please feel free to check out my projects and reach out!
